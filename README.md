## Required Folders and Files (added content) created locally and committed to Github. Created a .gitignore file and had to back track to be sure the files already committed would be ignored which is the purpose of this file type.

## Twitter account created with read and write permissions. Sent out multiple tweets and have received multiple retweets, likes and followers!

## Coding delayed due to issues (reported to Ricky C.) but will be completed by Friday.
