## Required Folders and Files (added content) created locally and committed to Github.

## Created a .gitignore file and this readme file committed to Github.

## Untracked the files listed in the .gitignore file using the git rm --cached FILENAME command to be sure the files already committed would be ignored and not copied which is the purpose of this file type. Committed these changes.

## Twitter account created with read and write permissions. Sent out multiple tweets and have received multiple retweets, likes and followers!

## Coding delayed due to issues (reported to Ricky C.) but will be completed by Friday.
